# Simplest possible example of uploading files to Node.js

This repo contains the simplest possible example of uploading files from a web page to your Node.js server.

Know a simpler way to do this? Please let me know, if I agree, we'll update this example and you can get the credit for your idea.

## Example 1

The subdirectory `./example-1` contains the first example. This is the absolute simplest code example for uploading a file from a web page to a Node.js HTTP server (Express.js).

Please see the README.md in the subdirectory for instuctions.

## Example 2

The subdirectory `./example-2` contains the second example. This example is a little more complicated because it accounts for the fact that often we'd like to used `body-parser` to parse most of our HTTP routes as JSON (except of course for the routes that implement file upload).

Please see the README.md in the subdirectory for instuctions.
